      "text: Full Credit to IBM Technology\n",
      "If you’re building applications with large language models, you’ll likely come across two frameworks: LangChain and LangGraph. Both are open source, both are powerful, and both are designed to help developers create LLM-powered applications. But they’re not the same. So what’s the difference, and when should you use one over the other?\n",
      "Let’s start with LangChain.\n",
      "LangChain: Chaining LLM Operations\n",
      "LangChain is built around the idea of chaining operations. At its core, it’s a framework for executing a sequence of functions in a chain. Think of it as a pipeline where each step depends on the output of the previous one.\n",
      "For example, imagine you’re building an application that needs to retrieve data from a website, summarize it, and then answer user questions based on that summary. LangChain helps you break this down into three steps: retrieve, summarize, and answer.\n",
      "To retrieve data, you might use a LangChain component called a document loader. This fetches content from various sources. If the documents are large, you might use a text splitter to break them into smaller, meaningful chunks.\n",
      "For summarization, you’d use a chain that orchestrates the process. This might involve constructing a prompt to instruct the LLM and passing the request to the model. The answer step would involve another chain, possibly with a memory component to store conversation history and context, along with another prompt and LLM to generate the final response.\n",
      "One of the strengths of LangChain is its modularity. You can mix and match components to build complex workflows. For instance, the LLM used for answering questions might be entirely different from the one used for summarization. This flexibility makes it a great choice for applications where you know the exact sequence of steps needed.\n",
      "LangGraph: Stateful, Nonlinear Workflows\n",
      "LangGraph, on the other hand, is designed for more complex, stateful workflows. It’s a specialized library within the LangChain ecosystem, tailored for building multi-agent systems that handle nonlinear processes.\n",
      "Consider a task management assistant. The workflow here isn’t linear. It involves processing user input, adding tasks, completing tasks, and summarizing tasks. LangGraph models this as a graph structure, where each action is a node and the transitions between actions are edges.\n",
      "The central node is the process input node, where user input is received and routed to the appropriate action node. There’s also a state component that maintains the task list across interactions. Nodes like “add task” and “complete task” modify this state, while the “summarize” node generates an overview of current tasks.\n",
      "The graph structure allows for loops and revisiting previous states, making it ideal for interactive systems where the next step depends on evolving conditions or user input. This flexibility is what sets LangGraph apart. It’s designed for applications that need to maintain context over extended interactions, like virtual assistants or complex task management systems.\n",
      "Comparing the Two\n",
      "So how do LangChain and LangGraph stack up against each other? Let’s break it down.\n",
      "Primary Focus\n",
      "LangChain is about chaining LLM operations. It’s great for building applications where you know the sequence of steps needed. LangGraph, on the other hand, is designed for stateful, multi-agent systems with complex, nonlinear workflows.\n",
      "Structure\n",
      "LangChain uses a chain structure, or directed acyclic graph (DAG), where tasks are executed in a specific order. This works well for processes like retrieve → summarize → answer. LangGraph uses a graph structure that allows for loops and revisiting previous states, making it better for interactive systems.\n",
      "Components\n",
      "LangChain relies on components like memory, prompts, LLMs, and agents to form chains. LangGraph uses nodes, edges, and states to build graphs.\n",
      "State Management\n",
      "LangChain can pass information through the chain but doesn’t easily maintain persistent state across multiple runs. LangGraph, however, has robust state management. The state is a core component that all nodes can access and modify, enabling more complex, context-aware behaviors.\n",
      "Use Cases\n",
      "LangChain excels at sequential tasks, like retrieving data, processing it, and outputting a result. LangGraph is better suited for complex, adaptive systems that require ongoing interaction, such as virtual assistants that need to maintain context over long conversations.\n",
      "Which Should You Use?\n",
      "The choice between LangChain and LangGraph depends on what you’re building. If your application involves a clear sequence of steps, LangChain is likely the better choice. Its modular design and focus on chaining operations make it ideal for straightforward workflows.\n",
      "But if you’re building something more complex — like a virtual assistant or a system that needs to handle multiple, interdependent tasks — LangGraph is the way to go. Its graph structure and robust state management make it perfect for applications that require flexibility and context awareness.\n",
      "Both frameworks are powerful tools for building LLM applications. The key is to understand the strengths of each and choose the one that best fits your needs. Whether you’re chaining operations or navigating complex workflows, LangChain and LangGraph give you the tools to build something great.\n",
      "Further Reading::\n",
      "Frequently Asked Questions\n",
      "1. What is the core purpose of LangChain?\n",
      "LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It achieves this by allowing developers to chain together various functions and components in a sequential manner. This enables the building of workflows where tasks are executed in a defined order.\n",
      "2. How does LangChain typically handle data flow within an application?\n",
      "LangChain uses a chain structure to process data, which is essentially a sequence of function executions. Data moves through this chain, and each step modifies it or extracts new information. For example, data might be loaded from a website, then split into smaller chunks, then summarized, and then used to answer a question. This sequential processing is a core function of LangChain.\n",
      "3. What is LangGraph’s primary focus compared to LangChain?\n",
      "While LangChain focuses on chaining LLM operations in a specific sequence, LangGraph is primarily designed for creating stateful, multi-agent systems. It allows for the development of workflows that are more dynamic and interactive than traditional LangChain applications, by focusing on building graph-based systems.\n",
      "4. What does a “graph structure” mean in the context of LangGraph?\n",
      "In LangGraph, the graph structure refers to a network of nodes (representing actions) connected by edges (representing transitions between actions). This setup allows for loops and the ability to revisit previous states, meaning the system can handle diverse inputs and navigate through the workflow in a flexible way that isn’t as easy with a linear chain.\n",
      "5. How does LangGraph handle state management differently from LangChain?\n",
      "LangChain can pass information between steps in a chain but doesn’t inherently maintain a persistent state across runs. LangGraph, on the other hand, has robust state management as a core component. Each node in a LangGraph application can access and modify the state, which allows for complex, context-aware behaviors that evolve throughout the interaction.\n",
      "6. What are some typical use cases where LangChain excels?\n",
      "LangChain is well-suited for applications involving sequential tasks like retrieving data, processing it, and generating outputs. Examples include summarization tools, text analysis pipelines, or question-answering systems with well-defined, linear processes.\n",
      "7. What kind of applications is LangGraph better suited for?\n",
      "LangGraph is ideal for complex systems that require continuous interaction and adaptation. This includes applications like virtual assistants that need to maintain conversation context over extended periods and manage various user requests. Its stateful nature and flexible graph structure make it suitable for these scenarios where the flow of the application is not linear.\n",
      "8. If an application needs to remember past interactions and use that information in the future, which framework, LangChain or LangGraph, would be better and why?\n",
      "LangGraph is the better choice for applications that need to maintain context and remember past interactions. This is because of its state management, where the state is a core component that all nodes can access and modify. While LangChain can pass data through the chain, it doesn’t have a persistent state feature, making it less suitable for applications requiring memory across multiple runs or dynamic workflow adjustments based on past interactions.\n",

      "text: Which AI Framework is Right for Your Project?\n",
      "With so many AI frameworks to choose from and new options emerging all the time, selecting the right tools for your artificial intelligence and machine learning projects can be confusing. Each framework offers unique features, so identifying the one that best aligns with your project’s goals is imperative. Among the most talked-about frameworks today are LangChain and LangGraph. Both have made significant strides in the AI community, but they cater to different needs.\n",
      "So, how do you determine which one is right for your project? In this article, we’ll break down the differences between LangChain and LangGraph. We’ll also show how they can work together to give you a complete AI solution and how LangSmith adds an extra layer of optimization. Whether you’re building a chatbot or analyzing complex networks, picking the right tool is key.\n",
      "Diving Into LangChain\n",
      "LangChain is a cutting-edge framework tailored for developers looking to leverage language models that enable them to craft intricate multi-step workflows. Its modular design facilitates API calls and concurrent processing, rendering it suitable for scalable AI solutions. Whether you’re looking for text generation, content summarization, or language translation tasks, LangChain equips you with the tools to execute these functions with accuracy and efficiency.\n",

      "- Flexibility: LangChain supports both pre-built and custom models, adaptable to projects of any size or complexity, allowing developers to tailor solutions precisely to their needs.\n",
      "- Memory Management: By employing context windowing and attention mechanisms, LangChain retains relevant information across multiple interactions, ensuring coherent and accurate responses.\n",
      "- Step-by-Step Reasoning: The framework leverages chain-of-thought reasoning to break down tasks into manageable steps, simplifying the development of complex AI workflows.\n",
      "- Seamless Integration: LangChain interfaces seamlessly with APIs and tools like OpenAI’s GPT and Hugging Face, enhancing its capabilities and allowing the integration of cutting-edge AI technologies.\n",
      "How LangChain Fits Into Your Tech Stack\n",
      "LangChain works with a wide range of programming languages and tools, so it can fit into many different development environments:\n",
      "- Python: LangChain is primarily built for Python, taking advantage of libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face.\n",
      "- JavaScript/Node.js: You can interact with LangChain models through APIs, making it easy to integrate with web apps.\n",
      "- Java, C++, and C#: Python and Javascript only currently have support, but you can always create an API using the Python and JavaScript libraries along with known frameworks like Django or Express.\n",
      "- Multiple Toolkits: Use the different toolkits to solve known problems. There are toolkits for searching, code interpreters, productivity, web browsing, databases, and more.\n",

      "Trusted by tech leaders at:\n",
      "What is LangGraph?\n",
      "LangGraph is different. While LangChain handles language, LangGraph is focused on mapping and understanding relationships in data. It’s perfect for visualizing and analyzing how different pieces of data are connected, whether you’re working with social networks, recommendation systems, or fraud detection models.\n",
      "How LangGraph Works\n",
      "LangGraph uses graphs to build stateful applications with large language models. It enables the orchestration of complex workflows with cycles and fine control over flow and state. It features built-in persistence for error recovery and human-in-the-loop interactions and integrates seamlessly with existing tools and frameworks.\n",
      "Additionally, LangGraph’s built-in persistence allows you to save and resume workflows at any point, facilitating smooth recovery from interruptions and supporting advanced use cases like time travel and long-term memory. LangGraph is perfect for creating dynamic, reliable multi-agent systems.\n",
      "LangGraph excels in projects that involve complex workflows with multiple stages and human interaction,where managing relationships and intermediate steps is crucial. Examples of such applications include:\n",
      "- Chatbots: Crafting advanced conversational agents for diverse purposes, such as handling customer support inquiries related to flights and reservations, generating prompts based on user requirements, or assisting with code analysis and generation.\n",
      "- Multi-Agent Systems: Coordinating interactions between multiple agents to handle complex tasks, whether it’s enabling agents to work together on a shared objective, managing oversight and delegation through a supervisory agent, or orchestrating nested teams of agents to address multifaceted problems.\n",
      "- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Enhancing information retrieval and generation\n",
      "through techniques like Adaptive RAG and Corrective RAG, which can involve using local LLMs or refining processes through iterative self-improvement. - Planning Agents: Implementing agents that can plan and execute tasks efficiently, handle reasoning without direct observation, or manage task execution through streaming and eagerly processing a planner’s DAG of tasks.\n",
      "Enhancing Your AI Workflow with LangSmith\n",
      "LangSmith is the final piece of the puzzle. While LangChain and LangGraph handle processing and relationship mapping, LangSmith helps with optimization. It’s a tool that monitors, tests, and improves your models, making sure everything works as efficiently as possible.\n",
      "- Monitoring and Debugging: LangSmith tracks how well your models are performing. It helps you\n",
      "find and fix the problem if something’s not working. - A/B Testing: Want to see if one version of your model works better than another? LangSmith lets you compare different versions and choose which is the best one.\n",
      "- User Interface: LangSmith provides a User Interface that makes it easier to work with both LangChain and LangGraph.\n",
      "Comparison of LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith: Features and Capabilities\n",
      "Conclusion: A Unified AI Solution\n",

      "This article gives a formal, side-by-side comparison of LangChain vs LangGraph, as well as where LangSmith and LangFlow fit. We will be building on concepts covered in other DataCamp articles and we will discuss when to choose each framework to ship production-ready, agentic AI systems. If you’re looking for a practical start to LangChain, I recommend the Developing LLM Applications with LangChain course.\n",
      "TL;DR\n",
      "Before diving into the details, here’s a quick overview of how LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, and LangFlow fit together and when you might choose each.\n",
      "- LangChain: The foundation, build modular LLM workflows (prompts, tools, memory, retrievers) using simple APIs like LCEL. Best for prototyping and linear apps.\n",
      "- LangGraph: The orchestrator, manage complex, stateful, branching workflows with retries, loops, and persistence. Best for resilient, production-ready, multi-agent systems.\n",
      "- LangSmith: The observer, framework-agnostic tracing, evaluation, and monitoring of LLM apps. Best for debugging, regression testing, and quality tracking.\n",
      "- LangFlow: The visual builder, drag-and-drop interface for quickly prototyping flows and exporting them to code. Best for teams, workshops, and non-coders.\n",
      "Quick heuristic: Start with LangChain, move to LangGraph as workflows grow, add LangSmith for observability, use LangFlow when you need fast iteration or collaboration.\n",
      "Introduction to LangChain and LangGraph\n",
      "Large language models (LLMs) are great at single prompts. This is pretty much common knowledge at this point, seeing as we use these models so often nowadays.\n",
      "However, real applications need workflows: fetch data, reason, call tools, ask a follow‑up, retry on failure, and sometimes pause for a human. Thus, there are two such frameworks you will hear again and again: LangChain and LangGraph. They live in the same ecosystem and often work together, but they solve different parts of the problem:\n",
      "- LangChain helps us build the steps\n",
      "- LangGraph helps us orchestrate these steps when things get complex.\n",
      "Speaking of ecosystem, we will also be discussing LangSmith (which is for observability/evaluation tasks) and LangFlow (which is a drag‑and‑drop visual builder), since they are also part of this ecosystem.\n",
      "A Brief History of the LangChain Ecosystem (2022–2025)\n",
      "I believe it makes sense to start with a bit of history around the LangChain ecosystem; it’s become the go-to framework for agentic AI, and knowing how it got here will make it easier to see why LangGraph, LangSmith, and LangFlow matter.\n",
      "- 2022 — LangChain is born: LangChain was launched as an open‑source project in Oct 2022 by Harrison Chase and team. It quickly became the go-to framework for composing LLM apps and, therefore, attracting a fast‑growing community and integrations.\n",
      "- 2023 — Popularity to Platform: LangChain formalized core abstractions and added LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) for pipe‑style composition. A new way to deploy chains as productions via API was also created, called LangServe. The company behind LangChain raised funding to accelerate ecosystem work.\n",
      "- 2023–2024 — Observability arrives with LangSmith: In the middle of 2023, and later generally available by early 2024, LangSmith introduced unified tracing, evaluation, and monitoring so teams could debug and test chains/agents and track quality over time.\n",
      "- 2024 — Orchestration with LangGraph: To support long‑running, multi‑step/agent apps, LangGraph introduced a graph runtime with explicit state, routers/branches, loops, retries, and checkpointers for persistence. This was a vital framework since it laid the foundation for durable, production‑ready agents. Subsequent updates expanded customization and integrations with different LLM providers, including Ollama (open-source models).\n",
      "- 2024–2025 — Visual building with LangFlow. The LangFlow visual editor evolved rapidly (major releases through late 2024 and a Launch Week in 2025), letting teams drag‑and‑drop LLM components, iterate quickly, and export flows to code. This was an important step because it started to allow non-coders the ability to build robust AI Agents as well.\n",
      "- 2025 — Toward managed agent platforms. LangChain announced major milestones: a Functional API for LangGraph, prebuilt agent templates, and a LangGraph Platform to deploy and manage stateful agents at scale. This is also quite pivotal, because it allowed us developers to operate reliable agents in production.\n",
      "Brief introduction to LangChain and LangGraph\n",
      "Let’s now start to dive deep into the core ecosystem, starting off with LangChain and LangGraph.\n",
      "LangChain is a modular framework for building LLM‑powered applications. It gives us building blocks - prompts, models, memory, tools, retrievers - and a simple way to chain them into a pipeline using its Runnable/LCEL APIs (we will discuss this shortly). I like to think of it as a kit of Lego bricks for common LLM patterns such as RAG, question‑answering, chatbots, and tools‑using agents.\n",
      "LangGraph is a newer, graph‑based orchestration layer built on LangChain components. Instead of one straight line of steps, the app is modelled as nodes (i.e., the actions) and edges (i.e., the transitions), with an explicit state object flowing through the graph. We will discuss this in more depth, but for now, remember that this design makes it natural to branch (take different paths), loop (ask clarifying questions until confident), retry (on tool/model errors), and pause for human review; exactly what we need for long‑running, production‑grade agents.\n",
      "Now you can have a question here:\n",
      "“Why even compare them?”\n",
      "Here is the thing: although they share components, they target different complexity levels:\n",
      "- LangChain excels at quick, linear workflows. Example: Load PDF → chunk → embed → retrieve → answer. You can prototype this in minutes.\n",
      "- LangGraph excels when logic must adapt. Example: If confidence < 0.7 → ask a clarifying question (loop); if payment fails → retry with backoff; if request looks risky → pause for human. These behaviors are first‑class in a graph.\n",
      "In practice, many developers start with LangChain to validate an idea, then upgrade to LangGraph as they add branching, error handling, multi‑agent coordination, or durability.\n",
      "What is LangChain?\n",
      "Now, we are going to go in-depth into LangChain, understand its usage, and code applications in it. Once again, note that LangChain is a library that allows us to build a foundation for sequential LLM workflows.\n",
      "LCEL\n",
      "To start, I want to explain what LCEL is. LCEL or LangChain Expression Language is just a way to connect blocks together with pipes (|). Each block can be a prompt, a model, a retriever or a parser. When we join them, we get a chain that we can run again and again, making writing code much more efficient.\n",
      "Let’s go through some examples.\n",
      "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n",
      "from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n",
      "from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n",
      "llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n",
      "prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n",
      "(\"system\", \"You are concise.\"),\n",
      "(\"human\", \"{question}\")\n",
      "])\n",
      "chain = prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() # This is our chain\n",
      "print(chain.invoke({\"question\": \"Give me 3 focus tips.\"})) # making a single call\n",
      "qs = [{\"question\": q} for q in [\"One tactic for RAG?\", \"Explain LCEL in 1 line.\"]]\n",
      "print(chain.batch(qs)) # many calls at once\n",
      "In my opinion, the above code cell shows the simplest way to use LCEL. We first made a prompt template that always includes a system message (“you are concise”) and leaves space for a human question. The system message is like an instruction to the LLM which tells it to respond/act in a specific way. We then connected this template to an OpenAI model - GPT-4o-mini.\n",
      "Lastly, I added an output parser, which basically converts the response into plain text.\n",
      "Now here comes the most important part: The | operator is what glues these blocks together into one pipeline.\n",
      "I also want to talk about invoke()\n",
      "and batch()\n",
      ". When we call chain.invoke(...)\n",
      ", the pipeline runs once, meaning the template fills in the question, the model generates an answer, and the parser returns clean text.\n",
      "However, when we call chain.batch(...)\n",
      ", the same chain runs on many inputs at once, which is much faster than looping one by one. In practice, this makes it easy to go from a simple, single call to handling whole datasets with almost no extra code.\n",
      "I want to showcase another example here:\n",
      "from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n",
      "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n",
      "from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n",
      "stream_chain = (ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"{topic}\") | ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\") | StrOutputParser())\n",
      "# Simple stream\n",
      "for chunk in stream_chain.stream({\"topic\": \"Explain PID in 2 lines\"}):\n",
      "print(chunk, end=\"\")\n",
      "This code is quite similar to the first once but instead of just calling it once, we use streaming. With .stream(...)\n",
      ", the model does not wait until the whole answer is ready. Instead, it sends chunks of text as they are generated, and we print them in real time.\n",
      "The main thing I want you to take away from this subsection is that LCEL is the simple “pipes and blocks” system that lets us snap prompts, models, tools, and parsers together and instantly gives us a chain we can run, batch, or stream without extra code.\n",
      "Structured outputs using Pydantic\n",
      "Structured outputs is a vital component of AI agents. It means that instead of our agent giving a long messy text, it gives the answer in a clear format like JSON, tables or lists. This makes it easier for computers and people to read, use and connect with other tools.\n",
      "One of the main frameworks which are used in industry for this is Pydantic.\n",
      "from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n",
      "from typing import List\n",
      "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n",
      "class TaskPlan(BaseModel):\n",
      "title: str\n",
      "steps: List[str] = Field(..., min_items=3, description=\"actionable steps\")\n",
      "structured = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\").with_structured_output(TaskPlan)\n",
      "plan = structured.invoke(\"Plan a 20-minute deep-work session for AI Agent notes.\")\n",
      "print(plan.model_dump())\n",
      "In this example, the method .with_structured_output()\n",
      "is the important part, as it tells the LLM to give the output in the Pydantic model form we had created. Behind the scenes, LangChain makes sure our agent’s answer is real JSON that matches the form, and then turns it into a Python object you can use straight away.\n",
      "So instead of messy text, we get something like TaskPlan(title=\"...\", steps=[\"...\", \"...\", \"...\"])\n",
      ". This is especially useful when we use Tools.\n",
      "Tool calling in LangChain\n",
      "Tools are important because they extend our LLM’s capability by being able to complete tasks that it was incapable of doing before, such as searching the internet.\n",
      "The thing I like most about tools, however, is that Langchain (and many of these agentic frameworks) provide ready-made tools called Built-In Tools that are quite easy to use. Moreover, we can also create our own tools by using a decorator @tool\n",
      ", which tells LangChain that this function is a special kind of function.\n",
      "from langchain_core.tools import tool\n",
      "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n",
      "@tool\n",
      "def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
      "\"\"\"This tool multiplies two numbers.\"\"\"\n",
      "return a * b\n",
      "llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n",
      "llm_tools = llm.bind_tools([multiply]) # exposing the tools to the model\n",
      "resp = llm_tools.invoke(\"What is 9*5? If needed, use a tool.\")\n",
      "print(resp.tool_calls or resp.content) # model may emit a tool call with arguments\n",
      "In the above code cell, you can see that I have created a very simple tool, which takes in two numbers and returns their product. To give the internal model (in this case GPT-4o-mini) access to such tools, we use the method llm.bind_tools()\n",
      "and pass in the list of tools, exposing the tools to the model.\n",
      "Conversational memory\n",
      "Memory is also quite vital when building AI agents. AI agents with memory can remember things from past conversations, like what we asked before, our preferences, or what worked or didn’t work. Without memory, every time feels like meeting someone brand new — we would have to repeat basic context again and again, which is quite cumbersome.\n",
      "In LangChain, memory means saving past messages or facts in a store (in memory, database, or vector store). Then when the agent runs again, it can pull in that memory so the responses feel consistent and smarter.\n",
      "There are two main kinds: short-term memory (recent messages in the same chat) and long-term memory (facts or preferences remembered across many sessions). Note that a session is a single conversation or interaction window, where our agent keeps track of what has been said until it ends.\n",
      "Short-term keeps context during a single conversation, while long-term makes the agent feel more personal and helpful over time.\n",
      "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n",
      "from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder\n",
      "from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory\n",
      "from langchain_core.chat_history import InMemoryChatMessageHistory\n",
      "prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n",
      "(\"system\", \"Be brief\"),\n",
      "MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"history\"),\n",
      "(\"human\", \"{input}\")\n",
      "])\n",
      "chain = prompt | ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\")\n",
      "store = {} # session_id -> history\n",
      "def get_history(session_id: str):\n",
      "if session_id not in store:\n",
      "store[session_id] = InMemoryChatMessageHistory()\n",
      "return store[session_id]\n",
      "with_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(\n",
      "chain,\n",
      "lambda cfg: get_history(cfg[\"configurable\"][\"session_id\"]),\n",
      "input_messages_key=\"input\",\n",
      "history_messages_key=\"history\",\n",
      ")\n",
      "cfg = {\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": \"u1\"}}\n",
      "print(with_history.invoke({\"input\": \"My name is Vaibhav.\"}, config=cfg))\n",
      "print(with_history.invoke({\"input\": \"What is my name?\"}, config=cfg))\n",
      "In the above cell, the code first creates a chat chain that can remember past messages in a session. The prompt has a history placeholder, and RunnableWithMessageHistory\n",
      "automatically fills it with the right conversation each time. The store keeps histories for different sessions.\n",
      "It is important to note, we should use memory carefully. We need to decide and write code for what is worth keeping, when to store it, and how much to pass back into the prompt. Here’s the thing, too much memory can slow things down or overflow limits, but the right balance makes our agents much more useful.\n",
      "What is LangGraph?\n",
      "We now move to the other agentic framework - LangGraph.\n",
      "To explain LangGraph simply, I am going to use an analogy: the Backpack Flowchart Analogy.\n",
      "We can think of LangGraph as a small flowchart for our AI app. Each box (called a node) is just a tiny Python function that does one job. The arrows (edges) say which box runs next. A little backpack of data (the “state”) moves through the flowchart, so each node can read it and add to it. For example, in a chat app, the backpack is usually the running list of messages.\n",
      "Fundamental graph\n",
      "This will make more sense if we go through an example together:\n",
      "pip install langgraph langchain-openai\n",
      "from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List\n",
      "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n",
      "from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n",
      "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n",
      "from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\n",
      "# This is the backpack that moves through the graph.\n",
      "class State(TypedDict):\n",
      "# To add messages to the state\n",
      "messages: Annotated[List, add_messages]\n",
      "llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\")\n",
      "# This is a node that asks the model and adds the reply to the backpack.\n",
      "def model_node(state: State):\n",
      "reply = llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])\n",
      "return {\"messages\": [reply]}\n",
      "# Building the graph\n",
      "graph = StateGraph(State)\n",
      "graph.add_node(\"model\", model_node)\n",
      "graph.add_edge(START, \"model\")\n",
      "graph.add_edge(\"model\", END)\n",
      "# Building and running once\n",
      "app = graph.compile()\n",
      "result = app.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"Explain LangGraph in one sentence.\")]} )\n",
      "print(result[\"messages\"][-1].content)\n",
      "Let’s walk through the code now. Here, we are building the simplest possible LangGraph app. The state is like a backpack, carrying messages through the graph. We define it with State,\n",
      "which tells LangGraph to always keep a running list of chat messages.\n",
      "Then comes the node, that is just a single function here, model_node\n",
      ", which looks inside the backpack, sends the messages to the LLM, and returns the reply. LangGraph then automatically adds this reply back into the backpack.\n",
      "The graph itself is a tiny flowchart: START → model → END\n",
      ". When we compile it, LangGraph turns this drawing into a runnable app.\n",
      "Finally, we run the app (not the graph - but rather the compiled graph) with a backpack that already contains a human message.\n",
      "To help build your visual understanding, we can run this code to view the graph:\n",
      "from IPython.display import Image, display\n",
      "display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n",
      "Please note, though, just because the visualization is produced, does not mean that the graph will run! There might be some logical errors which need to be taken care of first.\n",
      "Branching graph\n",
      "Let’s advance further, towards Branching, an important (but easy) component of any robust Agentic system. It allows our agents more freedom to make choices, turning it from a workflow to an agentic system.\n",
      "Let’s look at the code now:\n",
      "from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List\n",
      "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n",
      "from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n",
      "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n",
      "from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage\n",
      "# Defining the state\n",
      "class State(TypedDict):\n",
      "messages: Annotated[List, add_messages]\n",
      "llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n",
      "def answer_node(state: State):\n",
      "# Normal answer using the whole chat history.\n",
      "return {\"messages\": [llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\n",
      "def clarify_node(state: State):\n",
      "# LLm asking for a short follow-up to get enough detail (clarifying)\n",
      "return {\"messages\": [AIMessage(content=\"Could you share a bit more so I can be precise?\")]}\n",
      "# Router function\n",
      "def route(state: State):\n",
      "# Look for the latest human message and count words.\n",
      "last_human = next((m for m in reversed(state[\"messages\"]) if m.type == \"human\"), None)\n",
      "if not last_human:\n",
      "return \"clarify\"\n",
      "words = len(str(last_human.content).split())\n",
      "return \"answer\" if words >= 3 else \"clarify\"\n",
      "graph = StateGraph(State)\n",
      "graph.add_node(\"answer\", answer_node)\n",
      "graph.add_node(\"clarify\", clarify_node)\n",
      "# Adding a conditional edge to connect the router function\n",
      "graph.add_conditional_edges(START, route, {\"answer\": \"answer\", \"clarify\": \"clarify\"})\n",
      "graph.add_edge(\"answer\", END)\n",
      "graph.add_edge(\"clarify\", END)\n",
      "app = graph.compile() # Compiling the graph\n",
      "Most of this is similar to the first agent, except for the conditional edge. This allows us to provide the system with different potential routes based on the LLM’s judgment. Visually speaking, the system looks like this:\n",
      "With the power of conditional edges, we can build pretty robust agentic systems with our current knowledge. If you want a more comprehensive tutorial, I recommend checking out my LangGraph video tutorial.\n",
      "Recently, there has also been this new addition to LangGraph called LangGraph Studio, and I highly recommend this LangGraph Studio guide on it.\n",
      "What is LangFlow?\n",
      "Although LangChain and LangGraph are the two libraries most developers reach for in the Lang family, I believe it is worth briefly discussing LangFlow as well.\n",
      "Think of LangFlow as a drag-and-drop canvas for LLM apps. Each node = one step (prompt, model, tool, retriever, vector DB, file op, etc.). We connect nodes into a flow, then run it, export it, or deploy it. It’s great for quick iteration and especially good for collaborating with non-coders as well as for turning ideas into working agents fast.\n",
      "Now, yes, it is not as advanced as LangGraph and LangChain when it comes to building agents; however, there are some reasons to use it:\n",
      "- Visual builder to sketch flows quickly\n",
      "- Gives non-coders the ability to create agentic systems\n",
      "- Runs everywhere: web, and now LangFlow Desktop for local development\n",
      "- Export/import flows as JSON and for serving as APIs\n",
      "- Great for teaching, workshops, and quick prototypes without heavy coding\n",
      "- Export to code: hand off to engineers when stable.\n",
      "I am going to assume that you are in fact a non-coder, so really, you should use LangFlow when you are exploring architecture options (RAG variants, tool use, etc) and want to compare quickly or you need to communicate designs visually to stakeholders.\n",
      "To learn more about LangFlow and complete a project such as building a Tutor, I would highly recommend this LangFlow guide with demo project.\n",
      "What is LangSmith?\n",
      "The last library I want to cover is LangSmith. LangSmith is the observability + evals layer for LLM apps. It gives us tracing (basically allowing us to see every step, tool call, token, error), evaluation (datasets, automated & human-in-the-loop scoring) and for monitoring/alerts (track drift, regressions). An example of what a trace in LangSmith is can be seen below:\n",
      "There are lots of reasons why developers might use LangSmith:\n",
      "- Trace complex chains/agents end-to-end (inputs, outputs, latencies, errors)\n",
      "- Evaluate changes safely with datasets + automated/human graders\n",
      "- Monitor live traffic; catch regressions; compare versions\n",
      "- Plug-and-play with LangChain/LangGraph\n",
      "- Frame Agnostic, meaning LangSmith can be used with LangChain, LangGraph, or entirely different stacks.\n",
      "- Can be used in any language stack - JavaScript, TypeScript, Python\n",
      "For more information about LangSmith, I highly recommend this detailed introduction to LangSmith.\n",

      "Now we have covered and compared these 4 libraries in quite a lot of depth, but obviously there is a lot more to learn to become an advanced AI Engineer with these libraries. Therefore, I highly recommend courses such as RAG Systems with LangChain and building Agentic Systems with LangChain.\n",

      "text: Here at DuploCloud, we’ve been navigating the tumultuous waters of AI in an effort to champion its use in automating DevOps workflows (and make using it simpler).\n",
      "This has brought us face-to-face with some big questions about architectural components of AI-driven systems, such as LangChain vs. LangGraph. Let’s take a look.\n",
      "Both LangChain and LangGraph are open-source frameworks from the LangChain ecosystem that sound similar but play very different roles in the AI orchestra. Whether you’re a non-technical dreamer or a code-slinging developer, this article breaks down the differences with a sprinkle of fun and a lot of technical meat. Let’s dive in!\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "- LangChain is best for linear, modular AI workflows that call for a quick setup and minimal complexity, so it’s ideal for prototypes, simple chatbots, and RAG pipelines.\n",
      "- LangGraph excels in building complex, stateful, and multi-agent systems thanks to its graph-based architecture, explicit state management, and real-time streaming capabilities.\n",
      "- LangGraph and LangChain can be used together, which lets developers combine the simplicity of chains with the power of dynamic graphs for robust AI applications.\n",
      "For Non-Technical People: The Quick Scoop\n",
      "Picture LangChain as a trusty Swiss Army knife for building AI apps. It’s great for straightforward tasks like:\n",
      "- Fetching data\n",
      "- Summarizing it\n",
      "- Answering questions\n",
      "And it can do it in a neat, step-by-step flow. Think of it as a conveyor belt. You put the data in, it gets processed, and then it comes out nice and shiny.\n",
      "It’s easy to use, and it’s perfect for simple AI projects like chatbots or Q&A systems.\n",
      "Now, LangGraph is like a 3D puzzle board for more complex AI adventures. It lets you create workflows where multiple AI “agents” talk to each other. They also loop back and make decisions based on what’s happening in real-time. It’s ideal for intricate systems. It’s like a virtual assistant that:\n",
      "- Juggles tasks\n",
      "- Revisits decisions\n",
      "- Collaborates with other AI buddies\n",
      "If your project feels like a sci-fi plot with twists and turns, LangGraph’s your go-to.\n",
      "Bottom line: Pick LangChain for simple, linear AI workflows. Go for LangGraph if your AI needs to think, loop, and collaborate like a team of brainy robots. Now, let’s get nerdy for the developers!\n",
      "For Developers: The Technical Showdown\n",
      "LangChain and LangGraph are both built to make LLMs more than just fancy text generators. They’re frameworks for orchestrating complex AI workflows. But they approach this mission with different philosophies, architectures, and superpowers. Let’s break it down into key areas: architecture, workflow style, state management, use cases, and ease of use. Buckle up, and let’s code our way through the differences!\n",
      "1. Architecture: Chains vs. Graphs\n",
      "LangChain: Think of LangChain as a pipeline architect. It’s built around the concept of chains, where tasks are strung together in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), a fancy way of saying “one-way street with no loops.” Each step (or “chain”) takes an input, processes it, and passes the output to the next step. For example, you might chain a document loader to fetch data, a summarizer to condense it, and an LLM (large language model) to answer questions based on the summary. It’s modular, flexible, and loves linear workflows.\n",
      "Here’s a quick LangChain example using Python and the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):\n",
      "python\n",
      "from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n",
      "from langchain.llms import OpenAI\n",
      "from langchain.chains import LLMChain\n",
      "# Define a prompt and chain\n",
      "prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[“question”], template=”Answer this: {question}”)\n",
      "llm = OpenAI(model_name=”gpt-3.5-turbo”)\n",
      "chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\n",
      "# Run the chain\n",
      "result = chain.run(“What’s the capital of France?”)\n",
      "print(result) # Output: The capital of France is Paris.\n",
      "This is LangChain’s bread and butter: a straightforward, sequential flow that’s easy to set up and debug.\n",
      "LangGraph: Now, imagine a flowchart where tasks can:\n",
      "- Loop back\n",
      "- Branch out\n",
      "- Talk to each other like a team of AI agents\n",
      "That’s what you’ll get with LangGraph. It’s a framework that models workflows as cyclical graphs with nodes (tasks) and edges (data flow or transitions). Each node can be an:\n",
      "- LLM\n",
      "- A tool\n",
      "- A custom function\n",
      "Plus, edges can be conditional. This means dynamic routing is based on runtime conditions.\n",
      "LangGraph is perfect for stateful, multi-agent systems where the workflow isn’t a straight line. Instead, it’s a web of possibilities.\n",
      "Here’s a simplified LangGraph example for a task management assistant:\n",
      "python\n",
      "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n",
      "from typing import TypedDict\n",
      "# Define the state\n",
      "class TaskState(TypedDict):\n",
      "tasks: list\n",
      "user_input: str\n",
      "# Define nodes\n",
      "def process_input(state: TaskState) -> TaskState:\n",
      "# Route user input to add or summarize tasks\n",
      "state[“tasks”] = state.get(“tasks”, []) + [state[“user_input”]]\n",
      "return state\n",
      "# Create the graph\n",
      "workflow = StateGraph(TaskState)\n",
      "workflow.add_node(“process_input”, process_input)\n",
      "workflow.set_entry_point(“process_input”)\n",
      "graph = workflow.compile()\n",
      "# Run the graph\n",
      "result = graph.invoke({“user_input”: “Add a meeting at 3 PM”, “tasks”: []})\n",
      "print(result[“tasks”]) # Output: [‘Add a meeting at 3 PM’]\n",
      "LangGraph’s graph-based structure shines for workflows that need loops, conditional branching, or multi-agent collaboration.\n",
      "Key Difference: LangChain uses a linear, chain-based architecture (DAGs) for sequential tasks. LangGraph embraces a graph-based architecture with nodes and edges, supporting cyclical and dynamic workflows.\n",
      "2. Workflow Style: Linear vs. Dynamic\n",
      "LangChain: LangChain is your go-to for linear workflows. It excels at tasks where you know the exact sequence of steps. This includes fetching data, summarizing it, and answering a question. It supports simple branching, but it’s not built for complex, iterative processes. If your app is a straight shot from input to output, LangChain keeps things clean and simple.\n",
      "LangGraph: LangGraph is the maestro of dynamic, non-linear workflows. It’s specifically designed for scenarios where tasks might loop back. For example, a task management assistant might need to revisit previous tasks or handle conditional logic (“if the user says X, do Y”). They may also need to coordinate multiple agents (e.g., one for task creation, another for summarization). LangGraph’s graph structure makes this a breeze because it supports cycles and stateful interactions.\n",
      "Key Difference: LangChain is ideal for predictable, step-by-step processes. LangGraph handles complex, iterative, and multi-agent workflows with ease.\n",
      "3. State Management: Implicit vs. Explicit\n",
      "LangChain: State management in LangChain is implicit. It automatically passes data between steps in a chain, so you don’t need to manually track inputs and outputs. This is great for simple workflows but can feel restrictive if you need fine-grained control over the state (e.g., maintaining a task list across multiple user interactions). You can add memory components, but it’s not the core focus.\n",
      "LangGraph: LangGraph takes an explicit approach to state management. You define a state object (like a Python dictionary or TypedDict) that gets updated as the workflow progresses. Each node can read and modify this state. This gives you granular control. It’s important for long-running applications or multi-agent systems where you need to persist data. These can include conversation history or task lists across sessions. LangGraph also supports checkpointers for short- and long-term memory. This makes it ideal for stateful applications.\n",
      "Example: In the LangGraph task management example above, the TaskState object persists the task list across interactions, allowing the assistant to “remember” previous tasks.\n",
      "Key Difference: LangChain’s implicit state management is simple but less flexible. LangGraph’s explicit state management gives you full control, perfect for complex, stateful apps.\n",
      "4. Use Cases: When to Use Each\n",
      "LangChain Use Cases:\n",
      "- LongChain is your go-to when you need Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. Here, you’ll need to fetch docs from a database, embed them in a vector store, and query them using an LLM. This way, you can build knowledge-based chat interfaces when you need to ground responses in real data.\n",
      "- It will also shine for you in sequential NLP tasks. These include summarizing a document and then answering questions based on that summary. The step-by-step structure of LangChain makes these kinds of processes easy to manage and scale.\n",
      "- If you’re working with simple chatbots, LangChain is usually going to be plenty. Perhaps your application deals with basic Q&A, handles minimal branching, or walks users through predictable interactions. In this case, LangChain’s chain-based structure will keep things clean and simple.\n",
      "- LangChain is great for prototyping, especially when you need speed. You can quickly spin up proof-of-concept applications. And you’ll only need minimal code, thanks to its modular components like prompt templates, document loaders, and chains.\n",
      "- It’s also helpful when you want to build data pipelines that don’t require loops or feedback mechanisms. If your AI workflow processes inputs in a straight line, LangChain’s directed architecture is perfect for you.\n",
      "LangGraph Use Cases:\n",
      "- LangGraph is specifically designed for multi-agent systems. In this case, several AI agents need to work together. For example, one agent might create tasks, another can schedule them, and a third might summarize progress. Each one of these communicates with shared state and logic.\n",
      "- It also excels at complex task automation. This can include building a virtual assistant that loops over decisions, reacts to user inputs, or pauses for human approval. LangGraph’s graph-based architecture is perfect for handling conditional logic and recursive flows.\n",
      "- When you need to preserve state across sessions or steps, LangGraph is the better option. With it, you can maintain context in long-running conversations, store user history, and ensure the assistant remembers previous interactions across sessions and users.\n",
      "- LangGraph is also well-suited for production-grade systems. In this case, stability, observability, and fine-grained control matter. Companies like Klarna and Uber use it to manage critical AI workflows. This is thanks to features like checkpointing, streaming, and integrations with LangGraphs Studio.\n",
      "- Finally, it’s great for dynamic routing. These are scenarios where your app needs to make real-time decisions about what to do next based on changing outputs. You might be triaging tickets or interpreting ambiguous instructions. Or, you could be navigating conditional logic. In any of these cases, LangGraph offers the flexibility needed for intelligent branching.\n",
      "Key Difference: LangChain is great for linear, prototyping-friendly tasks. LangGraph is built for production-grade, complex, multi-agent workflows with dynamic control flows.\n",
      "5. Ease of Use: Simplicity vs. Power\n",
      "LangChain: LangChain is the friendlier of the two. It’s got a lower learning curve. Its modular components (prompt templates, document loaders, chains) and simple syntax make it perfect for developers new to LLM workflows. It’s also ideal for those building straightforward apps. You can get a chatbot up and running in a few lines of code. However, its abstractions can feel clunky for complex workflows. And some developers criticize its documentation and production reliability.\n",
      "LangGraph: LangGraph has a steeper learning curve due to its graph-based approach and explicit state management. You’ll need some object-oriented programming (OOP) knowledge to define state schemas and node functions, but this unlocks immense flexibility. It’s less about rapid prototyping and more about building robust, production-ready systems. Documentation can be spotty, but the framework’s flexibility makes it a favorite for advanced developers.\n",

      "We're releasing LangChain 1.0 and LangGraph 1.0 — our first major versions of our open source frameworks! After years of feedback, we've updated langchain\n",
      "to focus on the core agent loop, provide flexibility with a new concept of middleware, and upgrade model integrations with the latest content types.\n",
      "These two frameworks serve different purposes:\n",
      "- LangChain is the fastest way to build an AI agent — with a standard tool calling architecture, provider agnostic design, and middleware for customization.\n",
      "- LangGraph is a lower level framework and runtime, useful for highly custom and controllable agents, designed to support production-grade, long running agents\n",
      "These 1.0 releases mark our commitment to stability for our open source libraries and no breaking changes until 2.0. Alongside these releases, we're launching a completely redesigned docs site.\n",
      "Learn more about the changes below, and check our behind-the-scenes conversation with our engineers for more commentary.\n",
      "LangChain 1.0\n",
      "LangChain has always offered high-level interfaces for interacting with LLMs and building agents. With standardized model abstractions and prebuilt agent patterns, it helps developers ship AI features fast and build sophisticated applications without vendor lock-in. This is essential in a space where the best model for any given task changes regularly.\n",
      "We've been listening. Over the past three years, we've heard consistent feedback: LangChain's abstractions were sometimes too heavy, the package surface area had grown unwieldy, and developers wanted more control over the agent loop without dropping down to raw LLM calls. Some struggled with customization when their use cases diverged from our prebuilt patterns. We took this feedback seriously. LangChain 1.0 is our response— a thoughtful refinement that preserves what works while fixing what didn't.\n",
      "\"We rely heavily on the durable runtime that LangGraph provides under the hood to support our agent developments, and the new agent prebuilt and middleware in LangChain 1.0 makes it far more flexible than before. We're excited about 1.0 and are already building with the new features at Rippling.\" – Ankur Bhatt, Head of AI at Rippling\n",
      "We’re leaning hard into three things for LangChain 1.0:\n",
      "- Our new\n",
      "create_agent\n",
      "abstraction: the fastest way to build an agent with any model provider- Built on the LangGraph runtime, helping to power reliable agents\n",
      "- Prebuilt and user defined middleware enable step by step control and customization\n",
      "- Standard content blocks: a provider agnostic spec for model outputs.\n",
      "- Streamlined surface area: we’re trimming down our namespace to focus on what developers use to build agents.\n",
      "1. create_agent\n",
      "The create_agent\n",
      "abstraction is built around the core agent loop, making it easy to get started quickly. Here's how the loop works:\n",
      "Setup: select a model and give it some tools and a prompt.\n",
      "Execution:\n",
      "- Send a request to the model\n",
      "- The model responds with either:\n",
      "- Tool calls → execute the tool and add results to the conversation\n",
      "- Final answer → return the result\n",
      "- Repeat from step 1\n",
      "The new create_agent\n",
      "function uses LangGraph under the hood to run this loop. It has a very similar feel to the create_react_agent\n",
      "function from langgraph.prebuilts\n",
      ", which has been used in production for a year.\n",
      "Getting started with an agent in langchain\n",
      "is easy:\n",
      "from langchain.agents import create_agent\n",
      "weather_agent = create_agent(\n",
      "model=\"openai:gpt-5\",\n",
      "tools=[get_weather],\n",
      "system_prompt=\"Help the user by fetching the weather in their city.\",\n",
      ")\n",
      "result = agent.invoke({\"role\": \"user\", \"what's the weather in SF?\"})\n",
      "Most agent builders are highly restrictive in that they don’t permit customization outside of this core loop. That’s where create_agent\n",
      "stands out with our introduction of middleware\n",
      ".\n",
      "Middleware:\n",
      "Middleware defines a set of hooks that allow you to customize behavior in the agent loop, enabling fine grained control at every step an agent takes.\n",
      "We’re including a few built-in middlewares for common use cases:\n",
      "- Human-in-the-loop: Pause agent execution to let users approve, edit, or reject tool calls before they execute. This is essential for agents that interact with external systems, send communications, or make sensitive transactions.\n",
      "- Summarization: Condense message history when it approaches context limits, keeping recent messages intact while summarizing older context. This prevents token overflow errors and keeps long-running agent sessions performant.\n",
      "- PII redaction: Use pattern matching to identify and redact sensitive information like email addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers before content is passed to the model. This helps maintain compliance with privacy regulations and prevents accidental exposure of user data.\n",
      "LangChain also supports custom middleware that hook into various of points in the agent loop. The following diagram showcases these hooks:\n",
      "Structured Output Generation:\n",
      "We’ve also improved structured output generation in the agent loop by incorporating it into the main model <–> tools loop. This reduces both latency and cost by eliminating an extra LLM call that used to happen in addition to the main loop.\n",
      "Developers now have fine grained control over how structured output is generated, either via tool calling or provider-native structured output.\n",
      "from langchain.agents import create_agent\n",
      "from langchain.agents.structured_output import ToolStrategy\n",

      "prompt=\"Help the user by fetching the weather in their city.\",\n",
      ")\n",
      "Standard Content Blocks\n",
      "LangChain’s hundreds of provider integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) are largely unchanged in 1.0. The interfaces used by these abstractions live in langchain-core\n",
      ", which we’re promoting to 1.0 with one key addition: standardized content blocks.\n",
      "Much of LangChain’s value comes from its provider-agnostic interfaces, allowing developers to use a common protocol across multiple providers in a single application. Without standard content blocks, switching models or providers often breaks streams, UIs and frontends, and memory stores. The new .content_blocks\n",
      "property on messages provides:\n",

      "- Full backward compatibility\n",
      "This keeps LangChain’s abstractions current with modern LLM capabilities like reasoning, citations, and server side tool execution, while minimizing breaking changes.\n",
      "Simplifying the package\n",
      "LangChain 1.0 reduces package scope to essential abstractions. Legacy functionality moves to langchain-classic\n",
      "for backwards compatibility. As the framework has matured, we've learned what patterns matter most. This streamlined package cuts through years of accumulated features to make LangChain simple and powerful.\n",

      "LangGraph 1.0 addresses these gaps with a powerful graph-based execution model, and it provides production-ready features for reliable agentic systems:\n",
      "- Durable state - Your agent's execution state persists automatically, so if your server restarts mid-conversation or a long-running workflow gets interrupted, it picks up exactly where it left off without losing context or forcing users to start over.\n",
      "- Built-in persistence - Save and resume agent workflows at any point without writing custom database logic, enabling use cases like multi-day approval processes or background jobs that run across multiple sessions.\n",
      "- Human-in-the-loop patterns - Pause agent execution for human review, modification, or approval with first-class API support, making it trivial to build systems where humans stay in control of high-stakes decisions.\n",

      "text: AI agent frameworks serve as the foundation for building intelligent systems that can reason, make decisions, and complete difficult tasks. However, not every framework is necessarily beneficial for your project, and it’s essential to choose the one that will meet your use case and requirements best.\n",
      "LangChain and LangGraph represent two popular approaches to building AI agents, each with distinct strengths. In this article, let’s take a closer look at these two AI agent frameworks to help you make an informed decision about which one to choose for your project.\n",
      "LangChain and LangGraph are both designed to create intelligent, autonomous agents, but they differ in their approaches and focus areas. LangChain is a flexible, modular framework primarily focused on integrating large language models (LLMs) into complex workflows, while LangGraph is a visual, low-code extension of LangChain that provides a user-friendly environment for designing agent workflows. LangChain’s strength lies in its scalability and flexibility, making it ideal for advanced AI applications, while LangGraph simplifies the creation of both simple and complex workflows through its visual design.\n",
      "Here is a comparison table illustrating the key differences between LangChain and LangGraph:\n",
      "| Feature | LangChain | LangGraph |\n",
      "|---|---|---|\n",
      "| Framework type | Flexible, modular for LLM-based agents | Visual framework with a flow-based design |\n",
      "| Ease of use | Requires more configuration and coding | More intuitive, user-friendly, visual interface |\n",
      "| Integration with LLMs | Native integration with multiple LLMs | Supports LLMs but focuses on orchestrating agent workflows |\n",
      "| Code execution | Flexible, supports complex code execution workflows | Focuses on low-code/no-code execution, ideal for simpler flows |\n",
      "| Proxies and scrapers | Compatible with proxies for data scraping | Supports integration with proxies/scrapers in some configurations |\n",
      "LangChain is a highly versatile and flexible framework designed to integrate LLMs into a wide range of applications. It excels at building complex, scalable workflows that require multiple steps and sophisticated reasoning. LangChain enables developers to create intelligent agents that can interact with APIs, databases, and external systems in a dynamic manner. The framework’s modular design allows for custom implementations, making it suitable for use cases that involve advanced data collection, complex decision-making, and continuous learning.\n",
      "LangChain also provides robust features such as memory management, allowing agents to retain context across interactions, and tools like chains and agents that enable developers to structure multi-step workflows. Its flexibility allows it to work seamlessly with external systems, including proxies and scrapers, making it a powerful tool for web scraping tasks where high-frequency requests and large-scale data extraction are required.\n",
      "When building complex AI-powered systems with LangChain, one of the challenges is the need to interact with websites or services that have strict anti-scraping measures. Proxies help by allowing LangChain agents to make requests through different IP addresses, ensuring seamless and uninterrupted data collection. They also enable you to scale data scraping tasks without encountering blocking issues, and give quick access to geo-restricted content.\n",
      "For instance, rotating and residential proxies are useful with LangChain because:\n",
      "Rotating proxies provide a pool of IPs that change with each request, helping to avoid IP bans and throttling during high-frequency scraping.\n",
      "Residential proxies use real, residential IPs that appear as legitimate user traffic, making them ideal for bypassing sophisticated anti-scraping systems and accessing sensitive data.\n",
      "Choose LangChain in situations that require sophisticated reasoning and large-scale data collection. Some common use cases include:\n",
      "Customer support bots: Create conversational interfaces that follow predetermined paths. LangChain's straightforward structure makes it easy to build chatbots for customer service or information retrieval.\n",
      "Content generation: Whether for blog posts, product descriptions, or social media updates, LangChain’s LLM integration can automate the creation of engaging, relevant content at scale.\n",
      "Data extraction: For projects requiring large-scale data collection, LangChain can integrate with web scrapers and proxies to gather, process, and analyze information from external data sources.\n",
      "Personal assistants: Build AI-powered personal assistants that can handle a wide range of tasks, from scheduling to task management, all through natural language commands.\n",
      "Built on the foundation of LangChain, LangGraph is a visual, low-code framework designed to simplify the process of building AI agent workflows. It provides a drag-and-drop interface that allows users to visually design agent interactions and orchestrate tasks without the need for extensive coding. While LangGraph still leverages LangChain’s powerful backend for integrating LLMs and managing data, it focuses on intuitive, graphical design, making it accessible for users who prefer a more hands-on, visual approach to creating AI workflows.\n",
      "LangGraph supports modular components that can be connected to form powerful, dynamic workflows. This framework allows for easy handling of feedback loops, decision-making processes, and multi-step tasks, making it well-suited for real-time interactions, business process automation, and tasks that require constant refinement and adaptation.\n",
      "Additionally, LangGraph Platform is the core infrastructure that powers LangGraph, offering users the ability to design, test, and deploy workflows. LangGraph Studio, on the other hand, is the user-friendly interface that enables users to visually create and refine their agent workflows, offering an intuitive environment for building complex AI agents with minimal code. The main difference is that LangGraph Studio is the interface for workflow design, while LangGraph Platform serves as the underlying infrastructure that supports the entire workflow execution.\n",
      "Just like with LangChain, when building workflows using LangGraph, proxies are an important addition. LangGraph's visual framework is great for creating complex agent flows, but proxies help ensure that these agents can interact with a wide variety of websites without being blocked or limited by security measures.\n",
      "Proxies, such as datacenter ones, are a good fit for LangGraph when you need high-speed, reliable access to websites without the need for residential IPs. These proxies are ideal for tasks that don’t require stealth but still benefit from bypassing basic anti-bot systems, ensuring that LangGraph workflows run without interruption.\n",
      "LangGraph's visual interface and modular design make it easier to handle complex scenarios, such as multi-step reasoning or managing multiple agents interacting with various data sources. At the same time, it excels in cases where you need to design, monitor, and manage workflows in a more accessible way, compared to frameworks that require full custom coding. Some common LangGraph use cases include:\n",
      "Automated workflows: Automate repetitive tasks like report generation, data processing, or email outreach. Its visual workflow builder makes it easy to design automation pipelines without needing extensive coding knowledge.\n",
      "Real-time monitoring: Monitor systems in real-time, such as server performance or web scraping activities, and take immediate action when necessary. This is particularly useful for businesses requiring constant vigilance and automated responses to changes.\n",
      "IoT Integration: LangGraph’s visual approach is ideal for managing workflows that involve IoT devices or sensors, where each device action can trigger a sequence of tasks.\n",
      "Business Process Automation: Automate various business operations such as customer service management, marketing automation, or data entry, all through a user-friendly visual interface.\n",
      "LangChain and LangGraph both offer distinct approaches to building agents. LangChain excels in flexibility and scalability, making it ideal for complex applications that require deep integration with large language models. On the other hand, LangGraph is better suited for users looking for a more intuitive, visual approach to designing simpler agent workflows. At the end of the day, choosing between the two will depend on the specific needs of your project.\n",

LangChain excels in large-scale, advanced AI tasks, while LangGraph simplifies the process for users who prefer a visual design approach.\n",
      "No, LangGraph is not replacing LangChain. It builds on LangChain, offering a more accessible, user-friendly visual interface. Both frameworks serve different needs – LangChain for customizable, complex workflows and LangGraph for visual workflow design.\n",
      "No. LangGraph is built on top of LangChain's foundation and requires it to function. Think of LangGraph as a core component or an extension that adds new agent capabilities to the existing LangChain framework rather than a completely separate tool.\n",
      "Yes, LangGraph is suitable for production environments, particularly for use cases requiring automated workflows, business process automation, and real-time monitoring. It offers a straightforward setup and integration with LangChain’s backend, making it effective for both simple and more complex tasks.\n",

      "If you’re building applications with large language models, you’ll likely come across two frameworks: LangChain and LangGraph. Both are open source, both are powerful, and both are designed to help developers create LLM-powered applications. But they’re not the same. So what’s the difference, and when should you use one over the other?\n",
      "Let’s start with LangChain.\n",
      "Traditional cybersecurity methods aren’t enough. Models can be poisoned, stolen, or tricked in ways traditional software can’t. If you’re building AI, you need a new approach.\n",
      "LangChain: Chaining LLM Operations\n",
      "LangChain is built around the idea of chaining operations. At its core, it’s a framework for executing a sequence of functions in a chain. Think of it as a pipeline where each step depends on the output of the previous one.\n",
      "For example, imagine you’re building an application that needs to retrieve data from a website, summarize it, and then answer user questions based on that summary. LangChain helps you break this down into three steps: retrieve, summarize, and answer.\n",
      "To retrieve data, you might use a LangChain component called a document loader. This fetches content from various sources. If the documents are large, you might use a text splitter to break them into smaller, meaningful chunks.\n",
      "For summarization, you’d use a chain that orchestrates the process. This might involve constructing a prompt to instruct the LLM and passing the request to the model. The answer step would involve another chain, possibly with a memory component to store conversation history and context, along with another prompt and LLM to generate the final response.\n",

      "Podsumowanie\n",
      "- Na podstawie dostarczonych źródeł można stwierdzić jedynie, że LangGraph jest wymieniany w kontekście ekosystemu LangChain oraz jako narzędzie/platforma związana z tworzeniem agentów AI; źródła nie dostarczają szczegółowej, bezpośredniej definicji ani precyzyjnego opisu różnic funkcjonalnych między LangGraph a LangChain. [Source 1], [Source 2], [Source 3], [Source 4].\n",
      "\n",
      "Fakty jawnie podane w źródłach (wyciąg z materiałów)\n",
      "- LangGraph jest powiązany z LangChain w materiałach ikonograficznych i linkach: strona z ikonami LobeHub opisuje zasoby graficzne jako „LangGraph (LangChain) Application Logos” i wskazuje „Strona oficjalna: https://langchain.com/LangGraph”. To wskazuje na formalne powiązanie nazwy LangGraph z domeną/langiem LangChain w katalogu zasobów ikon. [Source 1].\n",
      "- W dokumentacji Google AI (artykuł zatytułowany „Utwórz od nowa agenta ReAct za pomocą Gemini 2.5 i LangGraph”) pojawia się stwierdzenie zaczynające się od „LangGraph to platforma do ...” (fragm. dostępny w snippetcie) oraz przykład instalacji wskazujący polecenie pip: „pip install langgraph langchain-google-genai”. Zapis ten jawnie informuje, że w ekosystemie oprogramowania istnieje pakiet „langgraph” oraz że w przykładzie używane są razem pakiety powiązane z LangChain i integracją Google GenAI. [Source 2].\n",
      "- Materiały edukacyjne/kursowe wymieniają LangGraph w kontekście nauki o agentach AI — kurs LangChain zawiera moduł/sekcję „LangGraph - wprowadzenie do tematyki agentów AI”, co potwierdza użycie LangGraph jako elementu edukacyjnego związanego z agentami (tematyka kursu). [Source 3].\n",
      "- Dyskusja na forum Reddit dotyczy „Jak hostować agentów langgraph jako usługę API” i w snippetcie sugeruje praktyczne podejścia (np. użycie Streamlit dla UI i FastAPI do utworzenia API), co ujawnia, że w praktyce istnieją „agenci langgraph” i że użytkownicy rozważają ich wdrożenie jako usługi API. [Source 4].\n",
      "\n",
      "Analiza powiązań (ściśle na podstawie powyższych źródeł)\n",
      "- Powiązanie nazwowe i linkowe: LobeHub etykietuje zasoby jako „LangGraph (LangChain)”, a link do „https://langchain.com/LangGraph” sugeruje, że LangGraph jest przynajmniej na poziomie nazewnictwa i zasobów traktowany jako element powiązany z projektem LangChain. Źródła jednak nie rozwijają formalnej definicji tego związku (np. czy LangGraph jest modułem LangChain, osobnym projektem utrzymywanym przez tych samych autorów, czy produktem komplementarnym). [Source 1].\n",
      "- Implementacyjno-praktyczne wskazówki: Dokumentacja Google AI i przykładowe polecenia instalacyjne pokazują, że istnieje pakiet „langgraph” oraz przykłady łączące go z integracją „langchain-google-genai”, co implikuje interoperacyjność lub współużycie w przykładzie tworzenia agenta ReAct z modelem Gemini 2.5. Jednak źródło nie opisuje architektury ani zakresu odpowiedzialności tego pakietu względem LangChain. [Source 2].\n",
      "- Zastosowanie w kontekście agentów: Kurs i wątek Reddit konsekwentnie umieszczają LangGraph w obszarze agentów AI i ich hostingu (wskazanie narzędzi do wdrożenia agentów jako API). To potwierdza, że LangGraph jest używany w praktyce do budowy lub zarządzania agentami, lecz bez szczegółów implementacyjnych czy kontraktów API. [Source 3], [Source 4].\n",
      "\n",
      "Czego źródła NIE podają (brak informacji)\n",
      "- Brak jakiegokolwiek fragmentu w dostarczonych źródłach, który jednoznacznie opisywałby: architekturę LangGraph, cele projektowe LangGraph w porównaniu z LangChain, granice funkcjonalne (np. czy LangGraph zastępuje pewne komponenty LangChain, rozszerza je, czy jest tylko warstwą narzędziową), modele licencjonowania, autorstwo/organizację utrzymującą LangGraph niezależnie od LangChain, ani formalne porównanie cech/PRZYKŁADÓW użycia. Innymi słowy: nie ma w źródłach szczegółowego opisu różnic funkcjonalnych lub projektowych między LangGraph a LangChain. No available information in the retrieved sources.

      "- Czym jest LangGraph: według fragmentów dostępnych materiałów LangGraph jest wymieniany jako „platforma” powiązana z tworzeniem agentów AI i jako pakiet/programistyczny komponent (polecenie instalacji pip: langgraph), oraz pojawia się w zasobach LangChain (np. dedykowany adres/sekcja na domain langchain.com i etykiety ikon) — co wskazuje na powiązanie z ekosystemem LangChain, a także na praktyczne użycie przy budowie agentów i możliwościach ich hostingu.
