## Appendix A — Business agents readiness checklist

Gate before Problem Radar / Vendor Discovery. Run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/acceptance/agent_os -m agent_os -q
uv run pytest tests/ -m gate -q
```

### Agent creation & registration

| # | Question | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Scaffold in minutes (`intergrax.scaffold new-agent`)? | ✅ |
| 2 | UAEP structure generated (contract, steps, tests)? | ✅ |
| 3 | First run in < 1 hour? | ✅ |
| 4 | Register via `AgentRegistry` only (no Nexus edits)? | ✅ |
| 5 | Capabilities in contract? | ✅ |

### Execution & observability

| # | Question | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 6 | Runs through NexusLoop / lab `/v1/lab/run`? | ✅ |
| 7 | UnifiedTaskRunner same path as HTTP? | ✅ |
| 8 | Graph sequential + parallel? | ✅ |
| 9 | Trace via `/debug/tasks/{id}`? | ✅ |
| 10 | Runtime events + checkpoints + progress? | ✅ |

### Recovery, HITL, memory, isolation

| # | Question | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 11 | Nexus validates output? | ✅ |
| 12 | Retry / alternate agent on validation failure? | ✅ |
| 13 | HITL pause + resume? | ✅ |
| 14 | Checkpoint recovery? | ✅ |
| 15 | Shared context in graphs? | ✅ |
| 16 | Sandbox + shadow workspace? | ✅ |

### Tooling & composition

| # | Question | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 17 | Canonical agent guide exists? | ✅ |
| 18 | Lab application (Tier-3)? | ✅ |
| 19 | Same agent reusable across applications? | ✅ |
| 20 | Applications contain wiring only? | ✅ |

### Go / no-go

| Criterion | Threshold | Current |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Checklist | ≥ 90% | **20/20** |
| Acceptance suite | 10/10 green | ✅ |
| Sign-off exercise | 1 new agent, < 1h, zero runtime edits | **Done** (`signoff_probe`) |

**Verdict:** **L1 Agent Operating System certified** (technical). **Phase S** (harness environment GA) is next; **K.1/K.2** wait until S is **Done**.

### Sign-off record

```text
Date:           2026-05-27
Agent exercise: signoff_probe
Capability:     signoff.probe
Time to first run: ~15 min (scaffold + smoke test)
Runtime files modified: none (only agents/signoff_probe/ added)
Smoke test:     agents/signoff_probe/tests — 1 passed
HTTP proof:     lab_application wiring + POST /v1/lab/run
Trace proof:    GET /debug/tasks/{id}, /trace?include_runtime=true, /events
                (test_lab_application_runs_signoff_probe_with_trace)
Acceptance suite: pass (tests/acceptance/agent_os)
Gate suite:     pass (228+ tests)
Trace:          NexusLoop smoke + HTTP debug API (SQLite trace store in lab factory)
Decision:       L1 certified — GO Phase S (harness environment), then Phase K (K.1/K.2)
```
