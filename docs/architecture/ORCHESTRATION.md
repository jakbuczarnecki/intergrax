# 9. Dual Loop Architecture

Intergrax uses a dual-loop architecture.

There are two types of loops:

1. Global Nexus Loop
2. Local Agent Loop

This is a required architectural decision.

---

# 9.1 Global Nexus Loop

The Nexus loop is mandatory.

The Nexus loop controls global execution.

Responsibilities:

- receive user task
- classify task
- determine complexity
- create or update plan
- select agents
- prepare context
- execute agents
- evaluate results
- decide next step
- handle retries
- coordinate parallel work
- coordinate sequential work
- request human approval when required
- finalize output

**Detailed runtime narrative** (sequence diagrams, decision matrix, `FLOW-GAP.*` plan rows): [`NEXUS_EXECUTION_FLOW_REFERENCE.md`](NEXUS_EXECUTION_FLOW_REFERENCE.md) §4–§18.

Pseudo-flow:

```text
while task.status not in [completed, failed, cancelled]:

    current_state = load_task_state(task_id)

    reasoning_result = reason_about_current_state(current_state)

    next_action = determine_next_action(reasoning_result)

    if next_action.type == "execute_agent":
        result = execute_agent(next_action.agent, next_action.input)
        store_result(result)

    if next_action.type == "execute_parallel_agents":
        results = execute_agents_in_parallel(next_action.agents)
        store_results(results)

    if next_action.type == "ask_human":
        pause_and_request_human_input()

    if next_action.type == "retry":
        execute_retry_policy()

    validation_result = validate_current_state()

    update_task_state(validation_result)
```

---

# 9.2 Local Agent Loop

Agents MAY have local loops — but loops MUST be **runtime-controlled** (§42.32, §42.33).

Local loops are allowed when an agent requires multiple internal steps.

The agent loop MUST be bounded by:

- the input contract
- the output contract
- max steps
- max time
- max cost
- allowed tools
- validation rules

Pseudo-flow:

```text
while local_goal_not_completed and limits_not_exceeded:

    local_state = inspect_local_state()

    local_next_step = decide_local_next_step(local_state)

    local_result = execute_local_step(local_next_step)

    validate_local_result(local_result)

    update_local_state(local_result)

return agent_output_artifact
```

# 9.3 Why Both Loops Are Required

If only Nexus has a loop:

- Nexus becomes too large
- Nexus micromanages every domain
- domain-specific logic leaks into the runtime
- implementation becomes rigid

If only agents have loops:

- global orchestration becomes chaotic
- agents become mini-platforms
- state becomes fragmented
- retries become inconsistent
- final output becomes unpredictable

Correct decision:

> Nexus has the global loop. Agents may have bounded local loops.

# 10. Nexus Responsibilities

Nexus is responsible for the following areas.

## 10.1 Task Intake

Nexus receives tasks from:

- chat interface
- Slack
- Teams
- API
- CLI
- internal scheduler
- webhook
- event trigger

Task intake normalizes input into a standard Task object.

---

## 10.2 Task Classification

Nexus classifies the task.

Possible classifications:

- simple question
- single-agent task
- multi-agent task
- long-running workflow
- monitoring task
- scheduled task
- human-approval-required task
- unsafe task
- unsupported task

---

## 10.3 Planning

Nexus creates a plan when needed.

A plan may include:

- steps
- dependencies
- agent assignments
- required tools
- expected artifacts
- validation criteria
- human approval points
- risk level

---

## 10.4 Agent Selection

Nexus selects agents based on:

- task intent
- agent registry
- declared capabilities
- required tools
- previous performance
- cost
- availability
- risk level

---

## 10.5 Execution Graph

Nexus manages the execution graph.

The execution graph defines:

- nodes
- dependencies
- parallel branches
- sequential branches
- waiting states
- retry states
- failed states
- completed states

---

## 10.6 State Management

Nexus owns global task state.

Global state includes:

- task id
- run id
- user input
- normalized task
- current plan
- execution graph
- agent outputs
- tool outputs
- validation results
- human messages
- final result
- status

---

## 10.7 Context Management

Nexus decides what context is passed to each agent.

Agents MUST receive only the context needed for their bounded task.

Nexus prevents uncontrolled context growth.

---

## 10.8 Tool And Adapter Access Policy

Nexus defines which tools and adapters an agent may use.

Agents should not automatically receive access to every integration.

Tool access should be explicit.

---

## 10.9 Validation

Nexus validates whether the global task is complete.

Validation can include:

- schema validation
- rule validation
- secondary agent validation
- tests
- consistency checks
- human approval

---

## 10.10 Final Response

Nexus composes the final response to the user.

Agents produce artifacts.

Nexus decides how artifacts are presented.

---


---

# 23. Task Lifecycle

Every task should move through explicit states.

Recommended lifecycle:

```text
created
    -> classified
    -> planned
    -> waiting_for_resources
    -> running
    -> waiting_for_human
    -> validating
    -> completed
```

Failure states:

```text
failed
cancelled
expired
partially_completed
needs_more_information
```

Every transition should be logged.

---


---

# 24. Execution Graph

Complex tasks should be represented as execution graphs.

An execution graph contains:

- nodes
- dependencies
- execution status
- assigned agent
- input
- output
- validation result
- retry count

Example:

```text
Task: Find business partner for AI logistics project

Node 1: Analyze project description
Node 2: Define partner criteria
Node 3: Search companies
Node 4: Enrich company profiles
Node 5: Score companies
Node 6: Validate ranking
Node 7: Generate final recommendation
```

Some nodes may run sequentially.

Some nodes may run in parallel.

---


---

# 25. Sequential And Parallel Execution

Nexus decides whether execution is sequential or parallel.

Sequential execution is preferred when:

- later steps depend on previous outputs
- task risk is high
- context must be controlled
- quality is more important than speed

Parallel execution is allowed when:

- subtasks are independent
- agents work on separate data
- research can be split
- validation can run independently

Nexus must merge parallel results.

---


---

# 26. Long Running Tasks

Intergrax must support long-running tasks.

Examples:

- monitor Reddit for problem signals for 30 days
- onboard new employees for 2 weeks
- analyze monthly sales data
- audit vendors over multiple stages
- review a large document set

Long-running tasks require:

- persistent state
- resumability
- scheduled execution
- progress updates
- failure recovery
- human interruption
- partial results

# 47. Checklist For Nexus Changes

Before changing Nexus, answer:

```text
1. Is this change domain-agnostic?
2. Does it belong in runtime rather than an agent?
3. Does it improve orchestration, lifecycle, validation or observability?
4. Does it preserve layer boundaries?
5. Does it make agents easier to implement?
6. Does it avoid hardcoded business logic?
7. Is the behavior traceable?
8. Can it support future agents?
9. Does it emit RuntimeEvents and respect UAEP (§42)?
10. Does it integrate with HookRegistry / middleware pipeline (§42.20)?
```

If the change is domain-specific, it probably belongs in an agent.
